Hi there 👋. Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Kieran Klukas, and I am a 10th-grade homeschooler, digital explorer, Homelaber, Videographer, and GNU/UNIX freak.

When I'm not doing school or working on a project, I enjoy takeing to the skies as an FPV (First-Person View) pilot. The thrill of soaring through the air and diving through gaps is a experience I can best descrive as pure joy. I try to capture my flights on my YouTube channel, [A Wanderer's Archives](https://youtube.com/@wanderer.archives).

My latest project's are: [#project-purplebubble](https://github.com/thepurplebubble) and a [contact card generator](https://github.com/kcoderhtml/ddg-vcf) that i developed for [#OnBoard](https://hackclub.com/onboard) by Hack Club
