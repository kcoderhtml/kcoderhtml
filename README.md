Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Kieran Klukas, a homeschooler in 10th grade with a passion for technology. I enjoy tinkering with various technologies as a Homelaber, exploring their inner workings and expanding my technical expertise.

Linux has a special place in my heart, and I proudly identify as a Linux enthusiast and distrohopper. The freedom, flexibility, and vibrant open-source community surrounding Linux captivate me, inspiring my exploration of different distributions and expanding my knowledge of this powerful operating system.

I'm deeply committed to digital privacy and advocate for online security and data protection. I strive to raise awareness about privacy best practices and empower others to safeguard their digital lives.

When I'm not diving into code, you'll find me taking to the skies as an FPV pilot, capturing awe-inspiring footage from unique perspectives. I'm also an Arc Browser evangelist, passionate about customizing and optimizing my browsing experience.

As an open-source enthusiast, I actively contribute to the open-source community, embracing the collaborative and innovative spirit it embodies. I believe in the power of open-source software and the positive impact it can have on technology and society.

Beyond technology, I find solace and artistic expression in playing the violin. It's a journey of discipline, growth, and the enchantment of beautiful melodies. Additionally, I'm an avid bookworm, exploring various genres, with a particular love for science fiction and fantasy.

Join me on GitHub as I share my projects, collaborate with fellow developers, and champion the values of privacy, open source, and innovation. Let's explore the possibilities together and make a meaningful impact in the world of technology.
